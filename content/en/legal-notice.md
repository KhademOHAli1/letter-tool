## ⚠️ AI-Generated Content - Important Notes

### Type of Service

This website provides a **support tool** for creating letter drafts. The AI (OpenAI GPT) generates **non-binding text suggestions** based on your inputs, which are expressly to be understood as drafts.

### User Responsibility

- **You as the user are solely responsible** for the final content of any letter you send.
- You are required to **review, edit, and adapt** every generated text before sending.
- By sending a letter, you assume full **legal responsibility** for its content.
- AI-generated content may contain **errors, inaccuracies, or unintended statements**.

### No Warranty

The operator provides **no guarantee** for the correctness, completeness, timeliness, or appropriateness of AI-generated texts. In particular, no liability is assumed for:

- Factual errors or false information in generated texts
- Legal consequences from sending letters
- Damages arising from the use of generated content
- The suitability of texts for a particular purpose

### Labeling under EU AI Act

In accordance with Art. 50 of the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (AI Act), we note: The text content generated by this service is created using **artificial intelligence (OpenAI GPT)**. The texts do not undergo editorial review by the operator. Editorial control and responsibility lies with the user.

## Voice Input

The optional voice input feature uses your browser's Web Speech API. Audio data is sent to your browser provider's servers (Google for Chrome, Apple for Safari) for speech recognition. We have no access to this audio data. Only the transcribed text is used in the form.

**Note:** You are responsible for the accuracy of transcribed content. Review the text before submitting.

The following data is stored locally in your browser:

- **Drafts (Auto-Save):** Your form inputs are automatically saved and deleted after 24 hours or successful generation.
- **Letter History:** Generated letters are stored locally until you manually delete them.
- **Settings:** Theme, language, and other preferences.

This data does not leave your computer. You can remove it at any time by clearing your browser data.

## Email Tracking

Emails initiated through this service may contain an invisible tracking pixel that detects whether the email was opened. This is solely for aggregated campaign effectiveness statistics.

**No personal data:** Neither your name, your email address, nor the letter content is captured.

## Liability Disclaimer for Free Services

This service is offered **free of charge and without commercial intent**. The operator's liability for damages of any kind arising from the use of this service is excluded to the extent permitted by law. This does not apply in cases of intent or gross negligence, or in cases of injury to life, body, or health.

**AI-generated letter drafts:** Under German copyright law, purely machine-generated texts do not enjoy copyright protection as they do not constitute a personal intellectual creation. Rights to the final, user-edited letters belong to the respective user.

## EU Online Dispute Resolution

The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR): [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/)

- Any use that violates German or EU law

If abuse is suspected, we reserve the right to block access and, if necessary, take legal action.

## Purpose and Political Classification

This tool is a **civil society advocacy project** of the Iranian diaspora in Germany. It supports people in advocating for human rights, freedom, and dignity in Iran with their elected members of the Bundestag.

The operator clearly positions itself **for human rights and against human rights violations** by the regime in Iran. This is a civil society position, not a party-political one. The service is independent of political parties, governments, or state agencies.

Users are free to adapt the generated texts according to their own convictions or not to use them.

## No Legal Advice

The information and generated texts provided on this website do **not constitute legal advice**. For legal questions, please consult a qualified attorney. The operator is not responsible for legal consequences that may arise from the use of generated letters.

## Changes and Availability

The operator reserves the right to change, restrict, or discontinue this service at any time without notice. There is no entitlement to permanent availability of the service. These legal notices may be updated at any time; the current version applies from the time of publication.

## Applicable Law and Jurisdiction

The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies exclusively, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. For disputes arising from or in connection with the use of this service, jurisdiction lies, to the extent permitted by law, at the operator's place of residence.

## Severability Clause

Should individual provisions of this legal notice be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected. In place of the invalid provision, a valid provision shall apply that comes closest to the economic purpose of the invalid provision.
